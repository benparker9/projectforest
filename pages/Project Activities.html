      <p1 class="p-1">The following tables have been designed and agreeded upon as indicators to track the potential impacts of<br> project activities. 
        Project Forest will plant 6,490,000 trees throughout 2024-2025.
        Indicators were formulated through<br> collaboration with RRG, FOU and local stakeholders.
        RRG and FOU will collaborate to ensure high accuracy field data<br> for modeling project GHG reductions. 
        RRG has created a stratified system of sampling based on species composition,<br> land tenure and land use type to establish long-term study plots.
        FOU will inventory species composition, density (trees/ha),<br> and DBH for each study site.
        To quantify changes in livelihood, FOU will survey employees and consult interviews with<br> local agency leaders.
        Below are the indicator tables for tracking the impacts of Project Forest.
