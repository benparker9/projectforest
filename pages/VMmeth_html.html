            <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
            <p1 class="intro">Reduce. Reuse. Grow has partnered with the Philippine Eagle Foundation and the Friends of the Usambara to plant over 9 million trees. RRG created a database with pertinent 
                information on each species planted, including relevant cultural significance, practical use, life cycle modeling, 
                and estimated carbon sequestration.

            <h1 class="method">Methodology</h1>
            <p1 class="methcont">
              Per section 8.6 of the VM 0047 methodology, the change in woody biomass is calculated from ex ante estimates of modelled growth and 
              yield values. RRG conducted a literature review and forest inventory to gather data on species’ DBH at an assortment of ages. RRG then 
              created a regression “engine” using the statistical programming language, R, to calculate values outside of the inventory. This engine 
              serves as a program to run many species’ models at once. It takes inputs (Age vs. DBH) and produces graphs, prediction curves and 
              statistical results. RRG utilized the port algorithm within the nls() function to solve for constants (a,b,c below). This algorithm 
              solves for residuals, or the difference between observed and predicted values. Models failed to converge, or solve, if the port algorithms
               first guess did not reduce the residuals. This is because some of the mathematical equations, primarily the Chapman Richard’s, did not 
               always represent the inventory data (sigmoid shape). In this case, the model would fail to converge and would crash the program. To 
               account for this, RRG utilized the tryCatch function within R to complete the program despite the model failing. When failures occurred, 
               the program would print the results from the previous success. This resulted in some species’ graphs showing inaccurate projections. 
               However, when selecting models, it is easy for users to not select those model predictions. The methodology and program code for the 
               engine is attached to the FRP website. Below are the five equations used and their initial parameter guesses:<br>
               1. 2nd Order Polynomial<br>
               f(x)=x^2 + x + b<br>
               Where f(x) = DBH (cm)<br>
               x= Age (years)<br>
               b = constant (did not need an initial estimate with the lm function)<br>
               2. 3rd Order Polynomial<br>
               f(x)=x^3 + x^2 + x + b<br>
               Where f(x) = DBH (cm)<br>
               x= Age (years)<br>
               b = constant (did not need an initial estimate with the lm function)<br>
               3. Logarithmic<br>
               f(x)=a + b * log(x)<br>
               Where f(x) = DBH (cm)<br>
               a= 0.5<br>
               b = 10<br>
               4. Power<br>
               f(x)= b * x ^ a <br>
               Where f(x) = DBH (cm)<br>
               a= 0.5<br>
               b = 10<br>
               5. Chapman Richard's<br>
               f(x)=a * (1-exp(-k * t))^b <br>
               Where f(x) = DBH (cm)<br>
               a= max(DBH)<br>
               k=0.3<br>
               b = 1 (can be 0-2.5)<br>
